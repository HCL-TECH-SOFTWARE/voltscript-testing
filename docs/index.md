# Welcome to VoltScript Testing Framework documentation

VoltScript Testing Framework is a framework for testing code written using VoltScript, the evolution of LotusScript, delivered as part of HCL Volt MX Go. The framework can be used for LotusScript with modifications.

There are no dependencies on any LotusScript Extensions (LSX), such as `nlsxbe.dll`. None should be added. It makes it dependent on a particular implementation.
